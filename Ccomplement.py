"""
Define a function reversecomplement that takes a DNA string as an input. 

-First the function should check if it is a valid DNA strand (use the function defined in the 1st part). If it's not, return "error".

-If it is a valid DNA string, the function finds the reverse complement of that string. The reverse complement is found by first reversing the string, then taking the complement of each nucleotide. A and T are complements of each other, and C and G are complements of each other.

For example,
reversecomplement("AAGCT") should return "AGCTT".

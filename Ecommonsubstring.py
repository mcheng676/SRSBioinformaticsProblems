"""
Define a function commonsubstring that takes a list of DNA strings as an input.

-First the function should check if all strings in the list are valid DNA strands (use the function defined in the 1st part). If it's not, return "error".

-If all strings in the list are valid, the function then finds the longest nucleotide substring that is in all of the strings in the list and returns it as a list. If multiples such strings exist, the function should include them all in the returned list.

For example,
commonsubstring("ACGCT", "CGCCA", "ATTACGCT") should return ["CGC"]
